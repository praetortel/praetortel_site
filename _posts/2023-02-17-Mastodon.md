I've really been messing with the fediverse lately. I've beeen working on a #nodered flow that automatically publishes blog posts to my Mastodon.

I won't get to crazy with it. I'm not a heavy blogger, but sometimes I have interesting ideas I want to share. 

This is a test post for my NodeRed flow. Read, or disregard as thou whilst.
