PraetorTEL is a private hobbyist telephone project ran by the only Wesley Fisher (aka; Praetor).

Praetor is no stranger to the wiley web, having been a netizen since 1993 via a dialup shell account to the University of Wyoming.

Praetor began his telephone journey in the summer of 2022 with a small Asterisk switch equipped with an Digium Analog FXO/FXS port. Since that time an application server has been added along with dial-in access to Praetor's retrocomputers, of which he is a fond collector of.

The specs PraetorTEL infrastructure is as follows:
* Primary Asterisk Switch - Hewlett-Packard Core 2 Duo with 16 gigabytes of RAM running Ubuntu 22.04 Server Edition, Asterisk latest with PraetoTEL patches.
* Application Server - Hewlett-Packard Quad-Core AMD with 32 gigabytes of RAM running Ubuntu 22.04. Runs Web, speech and message bus virtual machines as well as Docker.

Networking support is provided by Ubiquiti switches and routers.
